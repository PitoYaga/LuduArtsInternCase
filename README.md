# LuduArtsInternCase

This project was created for a job application to Ludu Arts.



An interaction system was created in this project. What does it include?

1. Character movement with WASD keys.
2. Rotating camera with cursor.
3. Three types of interaction.

&nbsp;	3.1.. Pressing Key: When a button is pressed, an interaction occurs, and the function of the object's intended purpose is executed. For example, items that could be picked up from doors and from the floor were tested.

&nbsp;	3.2.. Holding Key: Interaction can occur by holding down a key. If the interaction doesn't stop after certain time, the necessary function is executed. For example, you can try the box in the middle of the playing area.

&nbsp;	3.3.. Combining: If the player has an item that matches another item in their hand, interaction is possible and the required function works. To try it, you can pick up the blue cube from the floor and place it in the red box. After two seconds, it will give you another object.

4\. In addition to these, I also created a dynamic UI suitable for the interaction system.

&nbsp;	- The crosshair can be modified to suit the interaction. 

&nbsp;	- The interaction text can be written specifically for the object and can be changed from within the object if necessary. 

&nbsp;	- There is a progress bar for holding interactions.



Potential Problems:

1. You may experience problems with a complex and multi-combination system; the system needs to be updated.
2. Adding an input icon will require an update.
